# ncsulugposters
A set of posters made for the Linux Users' Group @ NC State.

These posters are intended for use by users of the members of the NCSU LUG to print or modify.
If you would like to print the posters, please print the PDF file using any PDF viewer. You can also print the .pptx file, but this is not recommended.
For best results, you should edit the .pptx file using PowerPoint, either with the app for Windows and macOS, or the webapp for all platforms (including Linux).
